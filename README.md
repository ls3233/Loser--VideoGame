# Loser-Game

This is a video game we made called "Loser"! 

We built it using a program called GameMaker. To play it, first download Gamemaker from http://www.yoyogames.com/studio and look for GameMaker Lite (it's free). 

Then, download the folders in this repo and import the scripts into GameMaker. Note that you can't select all the files and import them simultaneously. 
For example, from the objects section, you can only import all the files with names ending in .object.gmx. In total, you should import from 6 different folders before running the .exe file.

How to play: Use the directional arrows to move, and space bar to jump! Oh, and you might want to avoid the hazards.
